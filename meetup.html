        <p>The Meetup group that I attended is a JavaScript introductory course by Hack Reactor. The frequency of the Meetup event is that it happens consecutively every Saturday for 4 weeks straight. The objective of these meetup events are to teach beginners or people who need refreshers on the fundamentals and basics of JavaScript. The events are taught by instructors from Hack Reactor in hopes that participants of these events will join their Javascript program and courses after. Their events are usually every Saturday over Zoom live and videos are not recorded or posted elsewhere. </p>
        <p>The event I attended is called “Javascript 101.’ Through this event, I learned about what JavaScript is used for and how it plays an important role  in the technology world, the origin of Javascript, and some fundamentals of JavaScript such as: values, types, operators, keywords, labels, comments and functions.</p>
        <p> They have 4 courses available and once you participate in each course, they will give you an online code you can collect. Once you have all 4 codes from completing the course, you are able to redeem it and have their premium JavaScript course for free.</p>
