<h3>Tip 1: Mobile Optimization</h3>
   <p>According to Afreen from <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/seo-tutorial/seo-tips" target="_blank">Simplilearn: World's #1 Online Bootcamp</a>, "A good user experience on your website confirms that your audience can find it with ease.</p>
     <p>It is essential for marketers to know how important it is to make your site mobile friendly. A mobile-friendly website surely helps with ranking."</p> 
      <p> SEMRush confirms that by "2025, approximately 73% of internet users will access the internet through mobile devices".</p>         
      <p>Mobile-friendly updates by Google resulted in a significant change in website rankings.</p>
      <p>You can check how effective your site is mobile wise by using <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">Google's Mobile Friendly Test Tool</a>.</p>
        <h3>Tip 2: Future-Proof Your URL Structure</h3>
        <p>According to Avila from <a href="https://www.3mediaweb.com/blog/seo-website-redesign/" target="_blank">3 Media Web</a>, "One of the most important things you can do for SEO during a website redesign is to pick a standard formatting structure and stick with it."</p>
        <p>If you have multiple URL styles for each section of the website, you’re going to run into problems with your page rankings and, ultimately, getting your website on Google search results.</p>  
        <h4>Example: Categorize your product listings in your URL</h4>  
        <p>When a user sees a URL such as <a href="https://www.3mediaweb.com/web-services/web-design/" target="_blank">https://www.3mediaweb.com/web-services/web-design/</a> (Web Services > Web Design).</p>
        <p> It’s easy to see that web design is a service we provide and not, say, a blog post about web design, which we would categorize under <a href="https://www.3mediaweb.com/blog/category/web-design/" target="_blank"> https://www.3mediaweb.com/blog/category/web-design/</a>.</p>        
        <h3>Tip 3: Learn What Your Customers are <i>actually</i> searching for</h3>
        <p>According to Markov from <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-basics/" target="_blank">ahrefs (All in One SEO toolset)</a>,"You can’t optimize your website without knowing what your customers are searching for—that much is obvious."</p>
        <p>a) Figure out the most popular way people search for your business</p>
        <p>b) Understand other ways people may be searching for the same thing</p>
        <p>c) Delve deeper into the more granular searches your customers are making</p>
